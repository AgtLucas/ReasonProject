# Reason via `npm`

Example project using Reason as an `npm` dependency.

## Get Started:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/reasonml/ExampleProject.git
cd ExampleProject
npm install
npm start
```

If you are running as `root` already (you probably aren't) then invoke `npm
install --unsafe-perm` instead.

## Included Top Level

The top level `rtop` is built in to the sandbox: 

```sh
# Opens `rtop` from the sandbox.
npm run top
```
